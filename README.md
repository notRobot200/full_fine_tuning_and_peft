# full_fine_tuning_and_peft

This repository contains the implementation of full fine-tuning and PEFT (Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning) for a Large Language Model (LLM). The training process follows the hyperparameters provided in the Coursera course, with no further adjustments made.

- Hyperparameters were not modified, only following those provided in the course material.
- Human evaluation results are poor, as the main goal of this project is to understand and implement fine-tuning, not to achieve the best performance.
- This project is a learning experiment to explore the practical aspects of fine-tuning LLMs.
